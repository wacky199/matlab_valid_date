Just starting using github, so taking this file to understand the working of github
The  problem is,
Write a function called valid_date that takes three positive integer scalar inputs year, month, day. If these three
name of the output argument is valid. If any of the inputs is not a positive integer scalar, return false as well. No
except for years that are exactly divisible by 100. However, years that are exactly divisible by 400 are also leap y
2000 was. Note that your solution must not contain any of the date related built-in MATLAB functions
